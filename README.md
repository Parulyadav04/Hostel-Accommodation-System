# Hostel-Accommodation-System
Basically, this is a mini project which helps to manage the hostel accommodation.
This project is purely based  on C++ and its topics. I have tried to include my various learning of C++ in this project including file handeling,constructor etc.
So for this hostel accommodation system the user will be asked to choose from 6 options which are : 1. Display Available Rooms  2. Display All Students and Rooms  3. Book a Room  4. Vacate a Room  5. Search Room by Student Name and 6. Exit
I have also attached the output screen of the project in the file.
